Task:
=====

Implement a Web application listening at http://localhost:8080/. The application
serves a single Web page which lists records from the attached books.csv file, in the 
same order as they are in the file. The file resides on the server side 
where the application is running.

Each line of the file contains exactly one book record with exactly three fields:

<id>, <title>, <price>

Tip: use a text editor to view the file content.

Rules:
=====

1. The solution can be written in any programming language, and shall work in a Ubuntu 
Linux environment. It shall include a README file documenting the commands used to 
build and run the Web application (the fewer commands the better, Docker commands can 
be used if needed).

2. The solution shall be delivered as a Zip file containing the source code, 
configuration files, and any scripts needed to build and run the Web application. 
Binaries and dependencies shall NOT be included. The zip file must be smaller 
than 20MB (the smaller the better), named as
    coding_challenge_FIRST_NAME_LAST_NAME.zip (please replace with your name).

3. Software engineering and clean code best practices will be valued. Pls consider 
utilizing the time allowed for this.

4. The content of this coding challenge is confidential.
